## Introduction

PATH.JERRYIO is a multi-purpose path editor/planner which can be used to design routes for one-minute driver skill and generate path files.
More information about the editor can be found on the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/Jerrylum/path.jerryio).


## Getting Started

Before you start, please make sure you understand the following terms. The diagram below illustrates the definition of all the terms used in this editor.

<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
<img src={TermsAndConceptBackground} alt="" width="100%" />
<TermsAndConceptOverlay style={{ position: "absolute", left: 0, top: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} />
</div>

PATH.JERRYIO is using b√©zier spline to form a path. It consists of multiple segments, which are multiple b√©zier curves connected together, sharing endpoints.

Each b√©zier curve is either a cubic b√©zier curve or a simple b√©zier curve. A b√©zier curve is defined by its control points.
A cubic b√©zier curve has 4 control points, which makes it a "curve".
A simple b√©zier curve has only 2 control points, which makes it a "straight line".

All the control points(purple circle) can be called "Control",
but the shared endpoints(big purple circle) of the segments are called "End Control" in order to distinguish them.
Only end control points have heading attributes to indicate the target heading of the robot when the robot is at that point.

If you want to know more about b√©zier curve and spline, please check out these videos by Freya Holm√©r:
[The Beauty of B√©zier Curves](https://youtu.be/aVwxzDHniEw) and [The Continuity of Splines](https://youtu.be/jvPPXbo87ds)

Here are some basic operations you can do with the editor:

### Create

- Left click on the field to create curve at the end of the path
- Right click on the field to create line at the end of the path
- Right click on the path to insert a control point in the middle of it

### Modify

- Left click on a control point to select it
- Left click on a path segments(segment) to convert it into line or curve
- Drag a control point to shape the path
- To select multiple controls:<br/>
  - Hold shift and left click the controls; or
  - Drag a rectangle with/without holding shift key; or
  - Select controls in the Path Panel on the left
- To drag multiple controls simultaneously:<br/>
&nbsp;1. Select the controls<br/>
&nbsp;2. Drag one of the selected controls<br/>
- While dragging control(s), press shift to start magnetic mode
- Scroll middle wheel on an end control to change the heading

### Delete

- Right click on a control point to delete it
- Click delete button in the Path Panel to delete controls or paths

### View

- Hold ctrl + scrolling to zoom in/out
- Hold middle wheel button and drag to pan

### Save and Load Path Files

- Use Ctrl+S or select "Save" in the menu to save the path file
- Use Ctrl+O or select "Open" in the menu to load the file again

### Undo/Redo

Undo/Redo any modification with Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y or select Undo/Redo in the edit menu.
